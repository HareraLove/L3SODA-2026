Step 3: Add files to the repository  
Next, you need to add files to your repository. You can do this by creating new 
files in the repository directory, or by copying existing files into the repository 
directory.  
Once you have added files to your repository, you need to tell Git to track them. 
To do this, use the following command: git add <file-name>  
Replace <file-name> with the name of the file you want to track. You can also 
use git add . to track all files in the repository directory.
